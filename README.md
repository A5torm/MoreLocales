# MoreLocales
This mod (LocalizationPlus) adds the following languages to the game's settings and allows for mods to add their own localizations in the same way as they would do with natively supported languages: 
 
Japanese (ja-JP)  
Korean (ko-KR)  
Chinese - Traditional (zh-Hant)  
Turkish (tr-TR)  
Thai (th-TH)  
Ukrainian (uk-UA)  
Spanish - Latin American (es-LA)  
Czech (cs-CZ)  
Hungarian (hu-HU)  
Portuguese - Portugal (pt-PT)  
Swedish (sv-SE)  
Dutch (nl-NL)  
Danish (da-DK)  
Vietnamese (vi-VN)  
Finnish (fi-FI)  
Romanian (ro-RO)  
Indonesian (id-ID) 
 
<small>Wish to add another language to this list? [Make an issue!](https://github.com/Angeltrisi/MoreLocales/issues)</small>

# Important Note
Localization for vanilla entries is not currently supported in all of these languages. 
However, that is what I'm striving for, and if you speak any of these languages, I would greatly appreciate any contribution.
