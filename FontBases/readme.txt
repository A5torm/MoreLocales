The files found in this folder are recreation attempts for vanilla fonts, with extra added/changed character ranges and fonts to support certain languages.

As per my extensive testing, these fonts are perfect recreations, except for:
- My Source Han Sans font versions seem to be more updated than the ones Re-Logic originally used.
- The font used for Combat Text font numbers is close, but not an exact match.
