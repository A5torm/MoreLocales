Have you ever been disappointed in the lack of language variety Terraria offers by default? Localization+'s purpose is to quench your thirst for linguistic understanding!

[h2]Features[/h2]

• 18 new localizable languages (full list [url=https://github.com/Angeltrisi/MoreLocales/blob/master/README.md]here[/url])

• A brand new Language menu

• You can now freely use Hangul, Hiragana, Katakana, Vietnamese and Thai Script characters without compromising the base game fonts

[b]Notes[/b]
The mod currently contains scarce localizations for vanilla content in a small amount of the new languages, however, if you'd like to help out with making some translations, you can join the Discord or make direct contributions through GitHub.

If you're seeing this mod right after the release and you're a user, please realize that the mod does basically nothing other than give you a pretty language menu until other modders add the appropriate localizations into their mods, and until people contribute translations for vanilla content to this mod.
